		<h1>Radisson Blue</h1>

		<h2>3 nights at Radison</h2>
		<p>I arrived to Croatia and had to wait for my friend to arrive from Sweeden. I booked 3 nights in Radison and I do not regret it! Double bed room was hughe and interrier was like I have imagined it at my home. Staff was very helpful and sorted my issues in timely manner. I received a discount on SPA procedures what made my stay even more enjoyable. The price itself is not the gratest, but the service for that money is more than expected. Highly recomended!</p>
		<h3>Dimitri Bilan</h3>

		<h2>You must try book with Maritim</h2>
		<p>Maritim is the best place to stay if you are looking for comfort and good food. You must try Continental breakfast! the juice they serve is from freshly picked quality fruits and cotinental breakfast will give you energy for even all day. </p>

		<h1>Hilton Hotel</h1>
		<img src="images/hilton.jpeg" alt="Hilton Hotel" style="width: 300px; height: 200px;">
	
		<h2>My best experience with Hilton</h2>
		<p>This hotel chain is becoming more and more available and the service provided is at 10/10. Tree weeks ago I was coming back to UK, but due to weather conditions my flight was delayed for 12h. I booked a room for reasonably good price in Hilton and few h later I was glad my flight was delayed. Hilton upgraded my room to double with KingSize bed and lunch on house. Later that day I was offered to take a part in cocktail evening with entertainers. One of my best experiences here in Croatia!</p>

		<h2>In help when needed</h2>
		<p>Me and my husband decided to stay 4 more days in Croatia as the event came up last minute. We was supposed to check out by noon as our room was booked in for next guests. As the plan canged last minute whe needed to find a place to stay so we talked to receptionist Smiljana who immediately re-booked same room for us we stayed in and assigned other customers different one with no issues from both sides. Very good experience and Thank You Smiljana, she will do everything in her power to help you in dificult situations.</p>
